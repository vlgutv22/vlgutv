<strong>Male, 30 years old / 22.02.1992</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Hey! My name is Volodymyr Gutorov. I&#39;m a WEB developer with job experience more than 9 years. How a developer, I&#39;m working since 2012. My career has been started from the try to build the own web service, but this try was slammed because I was not so experienced in the market&#39;s process and sure I didn&#39;t have enough funds to run this startup. But this try showed me how development can help to resolve people&#39;s needs, how it&#39;s simple and fun. Since 2012 I don&#39;t stop to learn new technologies, I still feel that I&#39;m a young student with hunger to self-development and can&#39;t predict when I gonna stop... but I`m sure it happens not so soon, because each day I understand that it&#39;s just a beginning and how deep and exciting the tech world is.&quot;</p>
