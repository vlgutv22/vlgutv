## BIO

> **Male, 30 years old / 22.02.1992**

> " Hey! My name is Volodymyr Gutorov. I'm a WEB developer with job experience more than 9 years. How a developer, I'm working since 2012. My career has been started from the try to build the own web service, but this try was slammed because I was not so experienced in the market's process and sure I didn't have enough funds to run this startup. But this try showed me how development can help to resolve people's needs, how it's simple and fun. Since 2012 I don't stop to learn new technologies, I still feel that I'm a young student with hunger to self-development and can't predict when I gonna stop... but I`m sure it happens not so soon, because each day I understand that it's just a beginning and how deep and exciting the tech world is."
